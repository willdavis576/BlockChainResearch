sends:
	n/a - needs to find out what node has different information and auto-update the comprimised block

receives:
	nodesOnline (probs not needed)
	blockhashes - needs a custom message: <NodeName>, <productNumber>, <blockHash>
			NodeName can be used to create a 2D array, 1 dimension for the nodename and another
				for each blockChain's final hash
			product number can be used to deduce the current amount of blockchains produced
			blockHash is the final hash of each blockChain
