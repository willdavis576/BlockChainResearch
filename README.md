# BlockChainResearch

Here lies the heart of my final year porject and how my project has progressed over time. The main of this project was to implement blockchain technology into an Industry 4 system.

Since I needed a node based framework on which to build my blockchain, ROS was ideal since i had previous experience with it in robotics.

An obvious caveat to this project is, yes, ROS Kinetic is not decentralised like a traditional blockchain system but the software is written as if it is decentrailised, since ROS is just being used for the node based communication.
